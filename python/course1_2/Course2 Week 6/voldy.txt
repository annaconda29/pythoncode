Voldemort is the archenemy of Harry Potter, who according to a prophecy has "the power to vanquish the Dark Lord". 
He attempts to murder the boy, but instead kills his parents, Lily and James Potter and leaves Harry with a scar on his head in the shape of a lightning bolt.
 Nearly every witch or wizard dares not utter his name and refers to him instead with such monikers as "You-Know-Who", "He Who Must Not Be Named", or "the Dark Lord".
